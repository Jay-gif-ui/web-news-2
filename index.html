                    <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) celebrated a major milestone on May 2, 2023 - the 15th
                        anniversary of the release of the first Iron Man movie. The film starred Robert Downey Jr. as
                        the charismatic and wealthy industrialist Tony Stark, who later became known as the armored
                        superhero, Iron Man. The movie was a resounding success, launching the MCU and establishing
                        Marvel Studios as a force to be reckoned with in the global film industry.</p>
